## What is slpresentor ? ##
Slpresentor is a tool to manage presentations in meetings.

There is a "remote" object where you can put textures inside (you can use a texture for the parcel media for sure )

There is a "screen" object that you can duplicate in front of people or build a big screen or give it to people to make them wear it as a hud that will display the pictures you have choosen on your hud.

the textures should be full perms if you are giving the hud to someone else.
## How to use slpresentor? ##
you need to setup password and then push the buttons :)

the default "remote" version has a center image that shows what is actually displayed, and one image on each side to see previous and next image

when clicking on the next or previous image, this image becomes the actual one and is displayed on the "screens"
### buttons from left to right ###
  * the button on the left is "default texture" to quickly show a defined default texture if needed (for example this can be a logo of a company or the media parcel texture )
  * the red button is the reset button
  * view button to hide or show the screen ( by default, this is just colorizing in black but you can define an alpha value that can be usefull to hide the image during the time you are searching another image to show or get attention of your audience )
  * the last button on the right is to display a "glow" around the object (not working for huds) ( this option was a friend's request :) )

## How to setup the password ? ##
### Remote side ###
you need to wear the remote object and to write a password in the object's description

then you need to reset the script pushing the "reset" button
### Screen side ###
you can define the password editing the script or you can define it writing in the chat :
/999 pass;the\_password

the default one is 1234 so you can define it using : /999 pass;1234
